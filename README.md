# cricket-score-prediction

This data science project series walks through step by step process of how to build Cricket score prediction website. We will first build a model using sklearn and XGBoost regressor using T20 score dataset from kaggle.com. Second step Streamlit is an open source app framework in Python language. It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time.  During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code IDE
6. Streamlit to create web apps.
